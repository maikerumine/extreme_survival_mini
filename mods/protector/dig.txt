1.)how to tweak protector mod to cause damage to other players digging:

inside protector mod/init.lua, find function
protector.can_dig = function(r,pos,digger,onlyowner,infolevel)
and inside it a spot where player gets "this area is owned..." message, should be
like
minetest.chat_send_player(digger:get_player_name(), "This area is owned by "..owner.." !")

add to next line ( hurt player by 5 hearts)
digger:set_hp(digger:get_hp()-10);

2.) how to make a popup display that interrupts digging ( player must click close )
just add to same place as in 1.):

local name = digger:get_player_name();
local text = "Please do not build here ".. name .. ". Thanks. ";
local form = "size[4,1] textarea[0,0;4.5,1.5;text1;WARNING;"..text.."]";
minetest.show_formspec(name, "mymod:protector_warning", form) -- displays form
